Challenge was not to bad. I typed the solution in Swift playgrounds and it took over 30 minutes to compile and output the solution. While I was waiting, I typed the solution in Java and the solution came back almost instantly. I learned tonight that Swift playgrounds is not as fast and powerful as I thought.
